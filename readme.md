### What we provide
The patches, that you can find here (https://github.com/INTALIO/zimbra9FOSSPatches), are cleaned up from Zimbra Network Edition components.
We do not create patches ourselves, we use the official Zimbra repository.
If you want, you can use compiled version of Zimbra 9 FOSS by INTALIO, that is available on www.zintalio.com or make compilation yourself using our files.

Changes to the Zimbra build process are in this repository - just overwrite the files downloaded from the Zimbra orignal repository.
These changes do two things:
1. Adds Intalio repository with zimbra-patch package during Zimbra instalation.
2. Sends notification (thank you) to Intalio. (you can skip it with --skip-notify parameter). We do not send any information from your system, only IP.

With Zimbra 9 FOSS by INTALIO you can install Zimbra FOSS with the latest patch.

### What we guarantee
Always up-to-date Zimbra 9 FOSS version with patches.
Always free of charge!
